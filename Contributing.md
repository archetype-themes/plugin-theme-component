# Contributing to Archetype Themes' CLI

All contributions are welcome. To Contribute, create a branch, commit your code, and create a pull request.

## Install the plugin

Make sure you have installed the [shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli) first. Then, checkout the code
from the [plugin-theme-component repository](https://github.com/archetype-themes/plugin-theme-component) and link your
local copy to your shopify CLI instance. Here's an example of what that can look like on macOS

```shell
# Install shopify CLI on macOS using the oclif methods
brew tap shopify/shopify
brew install shopify-cli

# Checkout the repository in you projects folder, or any other location of your choice
cd ~/projects
git checkout https://github.com/archetype-themes/plugin-theme-component.git

# Link your local copy to the shopify CLI
cd plugin-theme-component
shopify plugins link
```

## Uninstall the plugin

Should you ever need to uninstall the plugin, use these commands

```shell
# From the project folder
cd ~/projects/plugin-theme-component
shopify plugins uninstall

# From anywhere
shopify plugins uninstall plugin-theme-component
```

## Contributing To The CLI's Development

### bin

Based on oclif CLI's recommended structure, this is the standard entrypoint for a CLI or, in this case, a CLI plugin.

### docs

Contains additional documentation on components and the plugin's structure and build process.

### resources

Contains static assets used internally when generating a new component or when running the plugin's dev command with
setup files enabled.


### src folder



#### factory

Factories create component instances. When instantiating a component, a factory should load all necessary data from disk
preparing grounds for the build process.

Factories load direct descendants automatically.
If you create a Component using the ComponentFactory, it should create instances and load data from its child snippets
using the SnippetFactory.

- Load all necessary data from disk for upcoming merge and/or transformation done during the Builder step.
- **SHOULD NOT** transform any data.
- **SHOULD NOT** install anything inside Themes or modify Themes in any way.

### builders folder

Builders are there to assemble and process file contents to deliver a final product.
\*This does not relate in any way to the Builder Design Pattern

- Should only be run after factories have completed component data model creation.
- Transform data as necessary using external processors, such as post-css
- Transform and merge data using internal processors, such as import-map
- Copy relevant files that do not need transformation to the build folder.
- **SHOULD NOT** load data from the disk that needs transformation.
- **SHOULD NOT** install anything inside Themes or modify Themes in any way.

### installers folder

Installers are meant to install Collection Builds in a Shopify Theme.

- Should only be run after factories and builders have completed their tasks.
- Copy the necessary final Build files to a Theme.
- Perform file merge with Theme files when necessary (i.e.: locale files)
- **SHOULD NOT** load data from the disk that needs transformation.
- **SHOULD NOT** transform any data.

### Errors

Contains custom Internal Errors used within the plugin

### Generators

The plugin's **generate** command will invoke generators to help create new components.

### Models

Shared data object models

### Processors

Processors transform data and should only be called by builders

### Utils

Various utility methods organized by topic.
