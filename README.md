A Shopify CLI plugin for building theme components.

The `plugin-theme-component` repository is a foundational part of the [Archetype Devkit preview](https://github.com/archetype-themes/devkit). It provides commands to create, develop, and install a collection of theme components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need to ensure you have the following installed on your local development machine:

- Latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started) (or another package manager of your choice)
- [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli/install)

### Installation

Simply run the following command to install the Shopify CLI plugin:
```bash
shopify plugins install plugin-theme-component
```

### Uninstalling the plugin

If you want to uninstall the plugin from the Shopify CLI, you can run the following command:
```bash
shopify plugins uninstall plugin-theme-component
```

## Development workflow

All plugin commands are [listed below](#list-of-commands) and you can learn more about [developing themes with components](https://github.com/archetype-themes/devkit/blob/main/1.%20Getting%20Started/d.%20Developing%20themes%20with%20components.md). In simple terms though, the development workflow is typically done in 3 different stages all using the plugin's commands:

### Creating components

You can create a new component with the `shopify theme component generate` command. This will generate a new theme component in the `components` directory with boilerplate code.

### Developing components

When developing a theme component, you have two separate workflows to choose from. You can either develop theme components:

- **Inside the [component explorer](#)**: the `shopify theme component dev` command launches the component explorer and allows you to develop components in isolation.
- **Inside a [Shopify theme](https://github.com/archetype-themes/reference-theme)**: the `shopify theme component dev --theme-path="../reference-theme"` command allows you to develop your components within the context of a specified theme.

### Installing components

You can install a component (or list of components) with the `shopify theme component install` command. This command is only ran within a [Shopify theme](https://github.com/archetype-themes/reference-theme.git), which then imports the latest changes of your components directly into your theme.

### Developing the plugin locally

If you already have the plugin installed via npm, you'll need to [uninstall](#uninstalling-the-plugin) the plugin before being able to develop the plugin locally.

Once this is done, follow these list of steps to ensure the Shopify CLI is running the local version of the plugin:
- `git clone https://github.com/archetype-themes/plugin-theme-component.git`
- `cd plugin-theme-component`
- `npm ci`
- `shopify plugins link`
