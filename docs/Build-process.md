# Build Process

Let's see what happens behind the curtains

## Liquid files

By default, any Liquid file detected in the component folders (recursively) will be merged in a single liquid file bearing
the name of the component and put at the root of the `build` folder. Files are processed in alphabetical order.

- Schema will be appended. The content will consist of an assembly of locales.json and schema.json

Output files :
```shell
build/snippets/[component-name-one].liquid
build/snippets/[component-name-two].liquid
build/snippets/[component-name-three].liquid
```

### JavaScript Build Process

The CLI will look for an `index.js` or a `main.js` file in your `src` folder. Any other javascript file or module that is
used by your main file will automatically be processed.

**Recursion:** If your Component includes Snippets with external javascript files, the CLI will also look for their main javascript file and process it.

**Notes**
- The mjs file extension is also accepted.

**Resulting files**

```shell
# For Collections
build/assets/[collection-name].js

# For Components
build/assets/[component-name].js
```

A reference to this JavaScript file will be inserted
- For A Component Build: At the end of the component's liquid file
- For A Theme Install: Just before the closing </head> tag of a `theme.liquid` file (only if missing - won't add twice)

```liquid
<script src="{{ '[collection-name||component-name].js' | asset_url }}" async></script>
```

**Note**
- Theme install: Customization of that script tag is possible. The CLI will check for an existing reference to the
  javascript file before insertion and will not proceed if it already exists, it will not be overwritten.

**External Tools**

JavaScript is built using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) bundler


### Stylesheets Build Process

The CLI will look for an `index.css` or a `main.css` file. Any
other javascript file or module that is used by your main file will automatically be processed.

**Recursion:** If your Component includes Snippets with external stylesheets, the CLI will also look for their main
stylesheet and process it.

**Notes**
- Use of a styles sub-folder is recommended but not compulsory. The CLI will recursively search the whole directory tree for your main stylesheet.

**Resulting files**

```shell
# For Collections
build/assets/[collection-name].css

# For Components
build/assets/[componet-name].css
```


A reference to this CSS file will be inserted
- For A Component Build: At the end of the component's liquid file
- For A Theme Install: Just before the closing </head> tag of a `theme.liquid` file (only if missing - won't add twice)
  A reference to this CSS file will be inserted at the end of the liquid file.

```liquid
{{ '${component-name.css}' | global_asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}
```

**External Tools**

Stylesheet are built using PostCSS

## Expected final Output

```shell
build/component-name.liquid
build/assets/component-name.js
build/assets/component-name.css
build/locales/en-US.schema.json
build/locales/fr-CA.schema.json
```
