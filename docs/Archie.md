# Archetype Themes' CLI

Archetype Themes' CLI (Command Line Interface) is designed to facilitate Shopify Theme development by making
it fast and easy to populate and maintain Themes with tons of Sections.

Gone are the days of manually copying sections from one theme to another, Archetype Themes' CLI allows you to create a
shareable Collection of Sections that we bundle as an NPM package. Add the dependency to install them within your
Shopify Themes.

**Main Benefits**

- Bundle as many Reusable Components, as Snippets, as you want, within your Collection.
- Share common JavaScript and Styles with your Sections
- Say _"goodbye"_ to duplicate code by sharing your Collection with as many Themes as you want
- Configure your Theme to use all or a selection of Components within a Collection
- Fix your bug once; in the collection repository.
  - Update the Collection dependency in your Themes repository.
- Javascript Import Maps automated generation will seamlessly improve loading time and responsiveness.
- Use postCSS post-processing for your Stylesheets to assemble everything in a single file.

## Prerequisites

Node.js needs to be installed, please follow the setup guide if needed.

- [Setup Guide](docs/Setup.md)

You need to authenticate to GitHub Packages Repository before you can install Archetype Themes' CLI and Components
Collections.

## CLI Components

Archetype Themes' CLI interacts with multiple component types: Components, Snippets, Component Collections, and Themes.

You can create and maintain a Collection of Components to share amongst your Themes. Collections are
structured as a Node.js Monorepo of child repositories of Components and shared elements in their respective workspaces.

## Installing The CLI

This is a shortcut command to install our CLI, but contextual use of this is provided in the guide links above.

```shell
# Defaults to the latest version
npm install @archetype-themes/plugin-theme-component

# Install a specific version
npm install @archetype-themes/plugin-theme-component#1.0.1

```

Available versions are listed on the
official [Archetype Themes' plugin-theme-component NPM package page](https://github.com/archetype-themes/plugin-theme-component/pkgs/npm/plugin-theme-component)

## CLI Commands

```shell
##### Collection Commands #####
npx component build
npx component build --watch
npx component build section [section-name]
npx component build section [section-name] --watch

npx component create section [section-name]
npx component create snippet [snippet-name]

##### Section Commands #####
npx component build
npx component build --watch

##### Theme Commands #####
npx component install
npx component install --watch
```

### Watch Flag

Using the watch flag, `--watch` or`-w`, will make the CLI keep an eye on source folders and refresh your build/install
on any source file change. You can stop the process by pressing **Ctrl+C** on your keyboard.

### Log Level

The CLI has a three-level log system, using the standard `info`, `debug`, `error` categories. `info` is the default
level. To use a different log level, use the following flags when running the builder command:

- `--verbose` will activate `debug` log level and a great number of details on internal processes will be
  displayed.
- `--quiet` will activate `error` log level. Only errors will be displayed.

```shell
# Show Error, Info and Debug messages
npx component build --verbose
```

```shell
# Show only Error messages
npx component build --quiet
```

## Current Limitations

- [Issue 21](https://github.com/archetype-themes/plugin-theme-component/issues/21): Collections must be part of the
  _@archetype-themes_
  namespace. Upon Theme Install, the namespace _@archetype-themes_
  is Hardcoded when searching for collections in _node_modules_ folder.
- [Issue 34](https://github.com/archetype-themes/plugin-theme-component/issues/34): Installing multiple collections in a
  theme is not
  handled at the moment.
